# Backend meets Frontend: Dependency injection in a Vaadin app
Dependency injection can be a tricky business. That's why frameworks like Weld or DDI help with the implementation. How this can work on a Vaadin project is shown in this part of the column "Backend meets Frontend". It also deals with the question of how easy or even difficult it is to change the DI framework retrospectively.


## How to start
To play with this you only have to start the main - method from the class  ```org.rapidpm.vaadin.helloworld.server.Main``` and 
go with your browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Ok, you got your first Vaadin "Hello World".
